# MY TEST REPOSITORY

As per its name, this micro-repository is a test space that I use for
self-learning Git and GitHub, by trying out their web and command-line
functionalities.

Specifically, much of the repository's commit history is directly related to the
[`Git & GitHub`](https://feat-fear.github.io/logSpace/docs/coding/git_survival/)
section of my [`log_space`](https://feat-fear.github.io/logSpace/), where my
knowledge on the subject is collected.
